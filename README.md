ArabBarometer Files
- Wave III original.geojson - the data exactly as Zach sent it (converted from Shapefile to GeoJSON)

- waveiii_modified.geojson - went through and validated all geocoded locations, changed a couple locations, and failed to validate locations I could not verify.

- waveiii_final.geojson - trimmed the `waveiii_modified.geojson` of any unvalidated locations and removed 1 feature that was in Gaza Strip
